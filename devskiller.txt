introduction

you are working on a multi-player board game called "race".
players are able to move on the board (strategy pattern),
some cards from the board are used for extra moves (chain 
of responsibility pattern), all players moves are logged 
and actual results are presented on a score board (observer pattern), 
of course, the game has an internal state like "waiting for players", 
"playing", "completed" (state pattern), to avoid unexpected actions.
